# `PerformAll` Pipeline — Deep-Dive Analysis

> **Entry point:** `src/main.rs:329` — `Commands::PerformAll { symbols_file_path }`

The `perform-all` subcommand is the **full end-to-end pipeline** of `market_int`. It takes a single argument — a path to a symbols file — and executes every stage sequentially: from pulling raw OHLCV candle data, through computing technical indicators, to retrieving option chains, scoring them, and publishing the top picks to Telegram.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### Step 1 — `quotes::pull_and_save()`

**Source:** `src/quotes.rs:8`

**What it does:**
1. Reads the symbols file (one ticker per line) via `symbols::read_symbols_from_file()`.
2. Creates the `candle` table in SQLite if it doesn't exist (`store::candle::create_table()`).
3. Initializes a Tiger API `Requester` — this sets up an RSA-signed HTTP client using credentials from `.env` (`TIGER_ID`, `TIGER_RSA`). The requester is used to call Tiger's `kline` endpoint for OHLCV data.
4. Iterates over symbols in **batches of 10** (Tiger API rate limit), calling `requester.query_stock_quotes()` for each batch.
   - Requests daily candles (`"day"` period), fetching the last **850 trading days** (`CANDLE_COUNT = 850`), which is roughly 3.4 years of history.
5. Saves each batch of candles into the SQLite `candle` table via `store::candle::save_candles()`.
6. Sleeps **1 second** between batches to respect API rate limits.

**Intent:**
- Establish a persistent local cache of daily OHLCV data for every tracked symbol. All subsequent calculations (ATR, Sharpe, max drop, etc.) are computed from this cached data, so the API only needs to be called once per pipeline run.
- 850 days provides enough history for meaningful 50-day EMA calculations and multi-year backtests.

---

### Step 2 — `maxdrop::calculate_and_save(period=5)`

**Source:** `src/maxdrop.rs:13`

**What it does:**
1. Reads symbols from the file and creates the `max_drop` table in SQLite.
2. For each symbol, fetches the last 850 daily candles from the `candle` table.
3. Computes **rolling max drawdowns** using sliding windows of size `period` (5 days):
   - For each 5-day window, tracks the highest high (`peak`) and finds the largest peak-to-trough drop: `max_drop = (peak - low) / trough`.
   - This produces a series of max-drop values — one per overlapping window.
4. From these rolling max-drops, it computes two summary statistics:
   - **`percentile_drop`**: The 90th percentile of all rolling max-drops (via `atr::percentile()` with `PERCENTILE = 0.9`). This represents the "worst case" drop that occurs ~10% of the time.
   - **`ema_drop`**: A 5-period exponential moving average of the rolling max-drops. This represents the "recent average" max drop.
5. Saves `(symbol, period=5, percentile_drop, ema_drop, timestamp)` to SQLite.

**Intent:**
- Quantify how much each stock tends to drop in a 5-day window. The 90th-percentile figure is the key input for computing the **lower bound of the put strike range** — i.e., "how far down could this stock realistically go in 5 days?"
- The EMA version captures recent volatility changes (e.g., if a stock has become more volatile recently).

---

### Step 3 — `maxdrop::calculate_and_save(period=20)`

**Source:** `src/maxdrop.rs:13` (same function, different `period` argument)

**What it does:**
- Identical to Step 2, but uses 20-day sliding windows instead of 5-day.
- Produces `percentile_drop` and `ema_drop` for the 20-day horizon.

**Intent:**
- The 20-day max drop is used as the **primary reference period** when computing strike ranges for the 20-day (Medium) option chain retrieval. A stock that drops 15% in a typical 20-day window needs puts with strikes at least 15% below current price to be considered "in the money" scenarios.

---

### Step 4 — `sharpe::calculate_and_save()`

**Source:** `src/sharpe.rs:8`

**What it does:**
1. For each symbol, fetches the last 850 candles.
2. Computes daily **log returns**: `r_i = (close_i - close_{i-1}) / close_{i-1}`.
3. Requires at least 14 candles (`SHARPE_MIN_CANDLES = 14`).
4. Computes the **annualized Sharpe ratio**:
   - Daily excess return = daily return − daily risk-free rate (risk-free rate = 0 by default).
   - Average daily excess return × 252 = annualized excess return.
   - Std dev of daily excess returns × √252 = annualized volatility.
   - Sharpe = annualized excess return / annualized volatility.
5. Saves `(symbol, sharpe_ratio, timestamp)` to SQLite.

**Intent:**
- Provide a **risk-adjusted return metric** for each stock. Stocks with negative or zero Sharpe ratios are filtered out during option scoring — the thesis is that you only want to sell puts on stocks with positive risk-adjusted momentum.
- A high Sharpe (> 1.0) means the stock has been consistently rewarding relative to its volatility — a good candidate for cash-secured put selling.

---

### Step 5 — `price_percentile::calculate_and_save()`

**Source:** `src/price_percentile.rs:7`

**What it does:**
1. For each symbol, fetches the last **20 daily candles** (`PRICE_PERCENTILE_DAYS = 20`).
2. Computes a simple **price percentile**:
   - Finds min and max close prices over the 20-day window.
   - `percentile = (current_close − min) / (max − min)`.
   - Returns 0.5 if all prices are equal (flat).
3. Saves `(symbol, percentile, timestamp)` to SQLite.

**Intent:**
- Measure **where the current price sits relative to its recent 20-day range**. This is the **momentum indicator**:
  - `percentile > 0.90` → **EXTENDED** (stock is near its 20-day high — risky for put selling).
  - `percentile > 0.80` → **HIGH** momentum.
  - Otherwise → **NORMAL**.
- Shown in the Telegram output and CSV for context, though it does not directly filter or score (the pre-filters in `calculate_put_score` do not use it).

---

### Step 6 — `trend::calculate_and_save()`

**Source:** `src/trend.rs:10`

**What it does:**
1. For each symbol, fetches the last **50 candles** (at least `EMA_LONG_PERIOD = 50`).
2. Computes two EMAs on the close prices:
   - **EMA20** (short): 20-period exponential moving average.
   - **EMA50** (long): 50-period exponential moving average.
3. Computes **trend ratios** (price relative to each EMA):
   - `trend_ratio_short = current_price / EMA20`.
   - `trend_ratio_long = current_price / EMA50`.
4. Saves `(symbol, ema_short, ema_long, trend_ratio_short, trend_ratio_long, timestamp)` to SQLite.

**Intent:**
- **Trend ratios > 1.0** mean the price is above the moving average (uptrend). **< 1.0** means the price is below (downtrend).
- Originally used as a pre-filter (reject stocks with `trend_ratio < 0.98`), but the trend filter was **subsequently removed** from `calculate_put_score()`. The data is still collected and stored because:
  - It feeds into the **Telegram caption** display (shows trend %).
  - It populates the `trend_short` and `trend_long` columns in the output CSV.
  - It's available for the backtesting module.
- The `calculate_trend_factor()` function (in `model.rs`) uses `trend_ratio_short` to tighten strike ranges for strong-trending stocks, though `PerformAll` currently hardcodes `trend_factor = 1.0` (no tightening).

---

### Step 7 — Initialize Tiger API Requester

**Source:** `src/main.rs:361`

```rust
let mut requester = match tiger::api_caller::Requester::new().await { ... }
```

**What it does:**
- Creates a new `Requester` struct with:
  - A `reqwest::Client` with a 3-second timeout.
  - An empty cache (`HashMap`) for option expiration data (populated lazily on first query).
- The requester authenticates every request with **RSA-SHA1 signatures** using the `TIGER_ID` and base64-encoded `TIGER_RSA` private key from `.env`.

**Intent:**
- **Reuse a single authenticated client** across both the 5-day and 20-day option chain retrievals. The `option_expiration_cache` is populated during the first call and reused for the second, saving API calls.
- Created here (after all local DB computations) to avoid holding an HTTP client open during CPU-bound indicator calculations.

---

### Step 8 — Set Market Regime (Hardcoded Bull)

**Source:** `src/main.rs:369`

```rust
let regime = crate::regime::MarketRegime::from_spy_trend(1.05);
```

**What it does:**
- Creates a `MarketRegime` struct with a hardcoded SPY trend ratio of **1.05** (price is 5% above its 50-day EMA).
- With `spy_trend = 1.05`:
  - `bearness = 0.0` (fully bull).
  - `trend_threshold = 0.98` (standard filter threshold).
  - `weight_safety = 0.30`, `weight_trend = 0.30` (equal weighting).
  - `flag = ""` (no warning label).

**Intent:**
- **Bypasses the dynamic SPY check** (which would require an extra API call to fetch SPY candles and compute its EMA50). In `perform-all`, time and API budget are conserved by assuming a bull market.
- The `regime` is passed into `option_chain_to_csv_vec()` which uses it for scoring. In the current code, `calculate_put_score()` uses **static weights** (safety 40%, return 40%, sharpe 20%) regardless of regime, but the regime struct is still plumbed through for future use.
- Contrast with `PullOptionChain5Day` / `PullOptionChain20Day` subcommands, which **do** call `compute_spy_trend()` dynamically.

---

### Step 9 — Load Sector Mappings

**Source:** `src/main.rs:370`

```rust
let sectors = sectors::load_sectors(&symbols_file_path).unwrap_or_default();
```

**What it does:**
- Reads the symbols file as a CSV with two columns: `SYMBOL,SECTOR` (e.g., `AAPL,Technology`).
- Builds a `HashMap<String, String>` mapping ticker → sector name.
- If the file is missing or unreadable, returns an empty map (all symbols default to `"Unknown"`).

**Intent:**
- **Sector diversity** in top picks. The `option_chain_to_csv_vec()` function enforces that no two top-3 picks share the same sector (unless the sector is "Unknown"). This prevents, e.g., picking AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA — all Technology — and instead promotes diversification across Energy, Financials, Healthcare, etc.
- Sector labels are also included in the Telegram caption for readability.

---

### Step 10 — `option::retrieve_option_chains_with_expiry(Short / 5-day)`

**Source:** `src/option.rs:290`

The orchestrator delegates to three extracted functions and then publishes:

```
retrieve_option_chains_with_expiry()
  → fetch_option_chains_in_batches()     // batch API loop → filter → save → return chains
  → collect_metrics_from_db()            // 4 DB queries bundled
  → fetch_earnings_map()                 // earnings calendar from Tiger API
  → publish_to_telegram()                // score → rank → CSV → Telegram
```

#### 10a. Read symbols & create table
- Reads symbols from file, creates the `option_strike` table in SQLite.

#### 10b. Determine period
- `ExpiryTimeframe::Short` → `period = 5`.

#### 10c. `fetch_option_chains_in_batches()`

**Source:** `src/option.rs:147`

Processes symbols in batches of 10 (Tiger API limit). For each batch:

1. **Get option expirations** — calls `requester.option_expiration()` to get all available expiration dates. Results are **cached** by symbol — reused for the 20-day retrieval in Step 11.
2. **Calculate target expiration date** — `get_expiration_date(Short)` returns ~5–7 calendar days from now using `SHORT_DAYS` lookup table indexed by weekday.
3. **Find nearest actual expiration** — `Requester::find_nearest_expiration()` matches the target against actual exchange expiration dates.
4. **Calculate DTE** — `calculate_trading_days_to_expiry()` counts trading days (excludes weekends).
5. **Compute adjusted strike ranges** — for each symbol in the batch:
   - Fetches `percentile_drop` and `ema_drop` from the `max_drop` table.
   - Fetches latest close price from the `candle` table.
   - Calls `calculate_adjusted_strike_range()` with `trend_factor = 1.0` (no tightening):
     - `adjusted_percentile_drop = percentile_drop × (dte / period)`
     - `adjusted_ema_drop = ema_drop × (dte / period)`
     - `v1 = price × (1 − adjusted_ema_drop)`, `v2 = price × (1 − adjusted_percentile_drop)`
     - `min_strike = min(v1, v2)`, `max_strike = max(v1, v2)` after safety adjustment
   - The **strike range** `[min_strike, max_strike]` defines which put strikes to query.
6. **Query option chain** — calls `requester.query_option_chain()` with strike ranges, underlying prices, expiration date, and `MIN_OPEN_INTEREST = 50`.
7. **Filter low-quality chains** — `filter_option_chains()` applies quality thresholds:
   | Criterion | Minimum |
   |---|---|
   | bid_size | 3 |
   | ask_size | 3 |
   | volume | 3 |
   | open_interest | 3 |
   | bid price | $0.03 |
   | ask price | $0.05 |
   | ask/bid ratio | ≤ 5.0 |
8. **Save to SQLite** — filtered chains saved to `option_strike` table.
9. Sleeps **1 second** between batches to respect API rate limits.

Returns `Vec<OptionStrikeCandle>` — all chains collected across batches.

#### 10d. `collect_metrics_from_db()`

**Source:** `src/option.rs:551`

Bundles four DB queries into a single call:
- **Sharpe ratios** → `collect_sharpe_ratios()` — from `sharpe_ratio` table.
- **Price ranges** → `collect_price_ranges()` — 20-day min/max close from `candle` table (for strike percentile calculation).
- **Price percentiles** → `collect_price_percentiles()` — from `price_percentile` table.
- **Trend data** → `collect_trend_data()` — `(trend_ratio_short, trend_ratio_long)` from `trend` table.

Returns a 4-tuple of HashMaps.

#### 10e. `fetch_earnings_map()`

**Source:** `src/option.rs:250`

- Calls `requester.query_earnings_calendar("US", today, today + period + 7 days)` to get upcoming earnings dates.
- Builds a `HashMap<String, EarningsInfo>` keyed by symbol.
- If a symbol reports earnings before option expiry, that information is surfaced in the Telegram message as a **⚠️ Earnings warning**.
- On failure: logs a warning and returns an empty HashMap (best-effort).

#### 10f. Score, rank, and publish to Telegram
Calls `publish_to_telegram()`, which orchestrates:

##### 10f-i. Score every option chain
`model::option_chain_to_csv_vec()` processes each `OptionStrikeCandle`:
1. **Strike percentile**: `calculate_strike_percentile(strike, min_price_20d, max_price_20d)` — where does this strike sit within the 20-day price range? A percentile of 0.0 means the strike equals the 20-day low (deeply in-the-money); 1.0 means it equals the 20-day high.
2. **Composite score** via `calculate_put_score(sharpe, strike_percentile, rate_of_return, trend_short, trend_long, regime)`:
      - **Pre-filters** (any failure → `None`, excluded from picks):
        - `rate_of_return ∈ [0.25, 0.80]` — avoids too-small premiums and too-risky puts.
        - `sharpe > 0` — only stocks with positive risk-adjusted returns.
        - `strike_percentile ≤ 0.40` — strike must be in the lower 40% of the 20-day range.
        - Note: trend pre-filters were removed — trend data is collected and displayed but not scored.
      - **Score formula** (static weights, regime-independent):
        ```
        score = 0.20 × sharpe_norm + 0.40 × safety_norm + 0.40 × return_norm
        
        where:
          sharpe_norm = clamp(sharpe / 2.0, 0..1)
          safety_norm = 1.0 − clamp(strike_percentile, 0..∞)
          return_norm = (rate_of_return / IDEAL_RETURN).min(1.0)  (IDEAL_RETURN = 0.80, asymmetric soft-cap)
        ```
      - The ideal put has: high Sharpe (consistent winner), low strike percentile (safe, near support), and high annualized return up to 80%.

##### 10f-ii. Select Top 3 picks with diversity
- All scored options are sorted by score (descending).
- Iterates through, selecting up to **3 picks** with constraints:
  - **Unique underlying** — no two picks from the same stock.
  - **Unique sector** — no two picks from the same known sector ("Unknown" sector is exempt from this rule).

##### 10f-iii. Generate CSV
- A full CSV is generated with all chains (not just top 3), including columns: underlying, sector, strike, bid, ask, volume, OI, rate_of_return, sharpe_ratio, strike_percentile, score, price_percentile, earnings, trend_short, trend_long.

##### 10f-iv. Send to Telegram
- The CSV file is uploaded as a document to the configured Telegram chat via the **Telegram Bot API** (`send_document`).
- A separate text message (`send_message`) is sent with the **caption** — a human-readable summary:
  ```
  🏆 Top 3 Puts — 06Jun 5-day

  1. AAPL (Technology) $185P | Bid: $1.50 / Ask: $1.80 | Return: 35%
     Score: 0.88 | Sharpe: 1.5 | Pctl: 72% | Trend: 103%

  ⚠️ Earnings: NVDA 2026-06-12 (AMC)
  ```

**Intent:**
- Deliver an **actionable daily digest** to the user's Telegram. The CSV provides full data for further analysis, while the top-3 caption gives an at-a-glance summary of the best put-selling opportunities with ~5-day expiry.

---

### Step 11 — `option::retrieve_option_chains_with_expiry(Medium / 20-day)`

**Source:** `src/option.rs:290` (same function, `ExpiryTimeframe::Medium`)

**What it does:**
- **Structurally identical** to Step 10, with two differences:
  1. **`period = 20`** — uses 20-day max drop data (from Step 3) for strike range computation.
  2. **Target expiration**: `get_expiration_date(Medium)` returns ~25–31 calendar days from now (`MEDIUM_DAYS` table), targeting the nearest standard monthly expiry.
  3. **Reuses the same `requester`** — the option expiration cache populated in Step 10 is reused, avoiding redundant API calls.
  4. **Reuses the same `regime` and `sectors`** from Steps 8–9.

**Intent:**
- Provide a **second time horizon** for put selling. 20-day puts offer:
  - Higher premiums (more time value).
  - Wider strike ranges (stocks can move more in 20 days).
  - Different risk/reward profile compared to 5-day puts.
- Publishing both timeframes lets the user choose based on their risk tolerance and market outlook.

---

## Error Handling Philosophy

The `PerformAll` pipeline uses a **"best-effort, continue-on-error"** pattern. Each step is wrapped in a `match` block that logs errors but does **not abort** the pipeline:

```rust
match step_function(...) {
    Ok(_) => log::info!("Success"),
    Err(err) => log::error!("Error: {}", err),
}
```

**Rationale:** If one symbol fails to fetch or one metric fails to compute, the pipeline should still process the remaining symbols and produce output. The only **hard stops** are:
- Tiger API requester initialization failure (no API = no option chains).
- Database connection initialization failure.

---

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **850-day candle history** | Enough for meaningful 50-day EMA and multi-year backtesting. |
| **Batches of 10** | Tiger API rate limit per request. 1s sleep between batches. |
| **90th percentile max drop** | Captures tail risk without being dominated by extreme outliers. |
| **Hardcoded bull regime** | Saves an API call in the full pipeline. Standalone commands (`pull-option-chain-5-day`) use dynamic SPY checks. |
| **Static scoring weights** (40/40/20) | Simplifies the model. Regime-based dynamic weights were removed after testing showed static weights performed better in backtests. |
| **Sector diversity in top 3** | Prevents concentration risk — e.g., 3 tech puts all dropping on the same NASDAQ selloff. |
| **WAL journal mode** | Better SQLite concurrency for the next read while writing. |
| **Earnings warnings** | Selling puts before earnings is risky (IV crush + gap risk). The warning lets the user decide. |
